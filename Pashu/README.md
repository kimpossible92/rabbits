# Pashu
A Realtime Strategy game where you build and manage an animal shelter.

# Gameplay:
The Gameplay is reminiscent of city-building simulators like sim city with your objective to
build and manage your animal shelter. You have to manage the finances, ensure your
animals are healthy and happy, set up adoption drives, and grow and expand your shelter
to provide the animals that have been left homeless a new and comforting home.
The main differentiating factor of the game is that unlike other strategy games which are
focused on only making a profit/running an empire, our game focuses more on the humane
aspect and works to bring out the best in you by taking care of cute animals while also
learning about animal conservation.

The Game teaches you the importance of animals and trees in a fun way and also teaches
you fun trivia and facts. It informs you about the benefits and clears the common myths
about adopting animals.
